# DeepSeek API Proxy

A high-performance HTTP/2-enabled proxy server designed specifically to enable Cursor IDE's Composer to use DeepSeek's and OpenRouter's language models. This proxy translates OpenAI-compatible API requests to DeepSeek/OpenRouter API format, allowing Cursor's Composer and other OpenAI API-compatible tools to seamlessly work with these models.

## Primary Use Case

This proxy was created to enable Cursor IDE users to leverage DeepSeek's and OpenRouter's powerful language models through Cursor's Composer interface as an alternative to OpenAI's models. By running this proxy locally, you can configure Cursor's Composer to use these models for AI assistance, code generation, and other AI features. It handles all the necessary request/response translations and format conversions to make the integration seamless.

## Features

- HTTP/2 support for improved performance
- Full CORS support
- Streaming responses
- Support for function calling/tools
- Automatic message format conversion
- Compression support (Brotli, Gzip, Deflate)
- Compatible with OpenAI API client libraries
- API key validation for secure access
- Docker container support

## Prerequisites

- Cursor Pro Subscription
- Go 1.19 or higher
- DeepSeek or OpenRouter API key
- Public Endpoint

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
go mod download
```

### Docker Installation

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t cursor-deepseek .
```
2. Run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 9000:9000 --env-file .env cursor-deepseek
```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here
# OR
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
```

## Usage

1. Start the proxy server:
```bash
go run proxy.go
# OR for OpenRouter
go run proxy-openrouter.go
```

The server will start on port 9000 by default.

2. Use the proxy with your OpenAI API clients by setting the base URL to `http://your-public-endpoint:9000/v1`

### Supported Endpoints

- `/v1/chat/completions` - Chat completions endpoint
- `/v1/models` - Models listing endpoint

### Model Mapping

- `gpt-4o` maps to DeepSeek's GPT-4o equivalent model
- `deepseek-chat` for DeepSeek's native chat model
- `deepseek/deepseek-chat` for OpenRouter's DeepSeek model

## Dependencies

- `github.com/andybalholm/brotli` - Brotli compression support
- `github.com/joho/godotenv` - Environment variable management
- `golang.org/x/net` - HTTP/2 support

## Security

- The proxy includes CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- API keys are required and validated against environment variables
- Secure handling of request/response data
- Strict API key validation for all requests
- HTTPS support through HTTP/2
